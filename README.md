# About
I wanted to learn more about the useContext hook in React and this was my project for that.
A simple task manager that will save your tasks to local storage.
Aside from entering a task, you will be able to edit current tasks, delete them one by one, or clear the task list (delete them all).
Unlike my other projects, I didn't do much in terms of styling (I used Material UI and some inline styling). Again, my focus was on using a context provider for managing states/data.
